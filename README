# Header-only c++ gpio library
# Odroid XU4 and N2Plus boards tested
# License GPL3
# The library built over the memory mapped gpio service. Tested with Debian 11 (Bullseye) both 32 and 64 bits.
# Not all pins are exposed. Use it as an example to expand pin list if necessary.
# For N2Plus it is more or less straight forward, for XU4 it is a bit more tricky but still possible with help of Odroid wiki pages.
